# CPWD-Tender-Data-Scraper
CPWD Tender Scraper is a Python-based tool that automates data extraction from the CPWD e-Tender portal. It navigates to the 'New Tenders > All' section, scrapes details like Tender ID, Title, Estimated Cost, EMD, and Bid Dates for the first 20 tenders, and saves them into a structured CSV file for easy analysis and tracking.
